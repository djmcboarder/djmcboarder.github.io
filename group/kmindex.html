<h1>Lower East Side, New York City</h1>

<h3>Tourists flock to this hip, downtown Manhattan neighborhood.</h3>

  <p>The eclectic Lower East Side is where gritty alleys and tenement-style buildings mix with upscale apartments and chic boutiques. Nighttime draws hip, young crowds to the area's trendy bars, music venues and restaurants. The neighborhood's Jewish heritage lives on through Orchard Street's Lower East Side Tenement Museum and old-world fabric stores, as well as traditional delis such as Katz's and Russ and Daughters. Here is a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/uCZgrds4rkT2">map</a> of the area. </p>

  <h4>Laboratorio del Gelato</h4>
    <div class="art"> <img src="images/il.jpg" /> </div>
  <div class="text"><p>This <a href="http://www.laboratoriodelgelato.com/thelab.php"> shop</a> takes its dÃ©cor and method from its nameâ€”with a minimalistic, white-tile, laboratory-like interior with a glass wall behind which customers can watch the scientist-chefs create new flavors. There are 94 flavors of gelato on tap, the pumpkin, salted caramel and green tea are recommended. The first taste of whipped cream will make you stop in your tracks. A dessert in itself! So creamy and delicious. The Pumpkin is clean, rich and light. Salted caramel flavors are so robust, simply decadent. Green Tea tastes like fresh grass with a tang.  You will be ruined after a trip, nothing can compare.ðŸ˜¥ 188 Ludlow Street.</p>

    <div class="art"> <img src="images/russ.jpg" /> </div>
    <div class="text"><p> Russ and Daughters is a treasure with both a rich selection of quality take away food and great service. Recommended are the salmon pastrami, coffee, babka ice cream sandwich and the "Fancy Delancey" sandwich which features smoked tuna, horseradish dill cream cheese and wasabi flying fish roe. Anthony Bourdain had it right when he said "Russ and Daughters" occupies that rare and tiny place on the mountaintop reserved for those who are not just the oldest and the last - but also the best." <a href="http://shop.russanddaughters.com/"> Russ and Daughters</a> is located at 127 Orchard Street, between Rivington and Delancey Streets. </p>

    <div class="text"><p> Unpretentious and friendly, <a href="http://places.singleplatform.com/tinys-giant-sandwich-shop-2/menu/">Tiny's</a> is named for its original owner who was a man large in stature and made sure there were delicious options for both meat eaters and vegetarians alike. It's a great place to grab lunch, a coffee or a casual dinner. You can order ahead and roll up to the side window on Norfolk and pick up your order in a flash. Great when you're hungry and need to walk the dog. Try the Big Mac Daddy, Tiny's Tasty Happy Salad or the Spicy Rizzak Sandwich. 129 Rivington Street.</p>
