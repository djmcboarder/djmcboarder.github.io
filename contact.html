    <h2>A Tribute to My Dad</h2>
    <p>My Dad had a big influence on me. His enthusiam for life, music and sports is something he passed on. Due to his love of baseball (he was actually a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/rays">Rays</a> fan later in life) it was difficult to watch  to the playoffs during the anniversary of his passing... I was thinking about him a great deal. So, when it came time to choose a project creating a tribute site made sense. Working on it, however, was much more than I bargined for as it's resulted in a shadow of sadness and I've stopped several times. However, challenges are what life's about so kept at it. </p>
    <p> Thinking about his life along with his many positive attributes there were areas which would have benefited from his attention and focus. Although he wasn't the best father I loved him and accepted him for who he was. He was a wonderful, imperfect man. </p>
