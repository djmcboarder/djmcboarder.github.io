    	<h2>Robert G. McNamara</h2>

    	<h3>It Was All About Sports</h3>
    	<p>The Yankees made the playoffs this year and elated, I thought of my Dad, the person responsible for my interest in sports. He would have been pleased to see the Bronx Bombers (aka <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2736257-the-baby-bombers-were-witnessing-the-beginning-of-mlbs-next-powerhouse">Baby Bombers</a>) with their young players and determination doing well this year.  A sports fan with more knowledge than I could ever hope to attain, he was always interested in talking about anything he had a passion for and it was contagious. So it was with mixed emotions that I watched the playoffs, October 17th was the seventh anniversary of his passing.</p>
