    <h2>A Tribute to My Dad</h2>
    <p>My Dad had a big influence on me. His enthusiasm for life, music and sports were attributes that he passed on. Due to his love of baseball (he was a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/rays">Rays</a> fan later in life) it was difficult for me to watch the playoffs during the anniversary of his passing... I was thinking about him a great deal. So, when it came time to choose a project, creating a tribute site made sense. Working on it was much harder than I anticipated though and it caused a shadow of sadness around me. Several times I decided to stop. However, challenges are what make us stronger and we can all use more strength so I kept at it. </p>
    <p>Thinking about my fatherâ€™s life results in a different summation than perhaps others would have. Many admired and looked up to him. He had many positive attributes, true. There were also areas in his life that suffered and would have benefited from his time and attention, especially his family. Even though he wasn't the best father (with time) I accepted him for who he was and loved him regardless. He was an interesting, imperfect man. </p>
